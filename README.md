# FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup
A simple script to install FreePBX on Raspberry Pi

 I was trying to install an opensource VoIP PBX on my Raspberry, however, has no much resources and tutorials online to make this. I dont't know why it is so hard, but here is a solution. This script will allow you to install FreePBX on a Raspberry Pi without spending much time and brain connections. LOL :)

 Recomended Hardware:
 Raspberry Pi 4 4gb
 32gb MicroSD Card
 Gigabit Ethernet


To make things easier:

```
sudo apt install git -y
sudo git clone https://github.com/theocastro/FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup.git
cd FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup
sudo chmod +x install
sudo ./install
```
