# FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup
A simple script to install FreePBX on Raspberry Pi

This is a simple way to install FreePBX on a Raspberry PI 3, 4 or 5. My personal recomendation is to use at least 4gb of RAM becasue voip is always using many things like call recording, log storage, and others. Reminding: this script was maded by Mr. Scott Phillips an you can find it at https://sourceforge.net/u/thatguy/profile
I also see a video about it. The link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXVLvxrEWeY&t=134s



To make thing more easier:

sudo apt install git -y
sudo git clone https://github.com/theocastro/FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup.git
cd FreePBX-Raspberry-Pi-Easy-Setup
sudo chmod +x install
sudo ./install




Special thanks for Mr. Scott Phillips and the YouTube channel Unify Communications.
